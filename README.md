# MGC/BioSB Course - Single Cell Analysis

This 4-day course will cover the practicalities of single-cell sample prep and analysis with a particular focus on single-cell RNA-seq libraries. This course is aimed at both wet-lab researchers interested in learning how to analyze their own single-cell data sets, as well as bioinformaticians who are new to single-cell sequencing analysis. Basic knowledge of the programming language R is a prerequisite for participation in the course.

The course features a mix of lectures and practicals, and you will have the opportunity to perform hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data in R. Topics to be covered in the course include (but not limited to): an overview of different single cell platforms, experimental design, preprocessing of scRNA-seq data, normalization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, batch correction, differential expression, trajectory inference, and spatial transcriptomics. The forth day of the course will be a mini-symposium featuring guest lectures from scientists using various single-cell techniques in their research.
